# Project: ORB Acceleration

## Introduction
In this project, you will accelerate the ORB feature extraction by HLS and run on the ZCU104 board.

For the details of the ORB algorithm, you can refer to 
* E. Rublee, V. Rabaud, K. Konolige, and G. Bradski, “Orb: An efficient alternative to sift or surf,” in 2011 International Conference on Computer Vision, 2011, pp. 2564–2571. 
* M. Calonder, V. Lepetit, C. Strecha, and P. Fua, “Brief: Binary robust independent elementary features,” in Proc. 11th European Conference on Computer Vision, 2010, pp. 778–792.


## Build Baseline
In this project, a baseline of the entire ORB implementation is given to you, follow the below steps to rebuild it. The toolchain version used is 2020.2.

1. Open CMD (not powershell), and run bellow command.
    ```
    C:\Xilinx\Vitis\2020.2\settings64.bat
    ```
    change the installation path if needed.

1. Change the directory to `Project` folder using `cd`.
1. Run C Simulation
    ```
    build.bat csim
    ```
    A Vitis_HLS project is created in folder `hls_project`. A small input file in `test` folder is provided for fast simulation, the reference output is:
    ```

    ```
    The output is the X, Y coordinates and the 256-bit descriptor. **It doesn't matter if your descriptor value is slightly different from the reference,** since the precision is measured by the Hamming Distance.

1. Run C Synthesis
    ```
    build.bat csynth
    ```

1. Run Co Simulation
    ```
    build.bat cosim
    ```
1. Generate block design
    ```
    build.bat bd
    ```
    A Vivado project will be created in folder `vivado_project`

1. Generate bitstream
    ```
    build.bat bit
    ```
    The `.bit` and `.hwh` file can be found in the `Project` folder

1. You can use a single command to generate bitstream. 
    ```
    build.bat all
    ```
    It is recommanded to clean the workspace before each run
    ```
    build.bat clean
    ```

## Run on the board
1. The Python scripts with test images is provided in the `board` folder.
1. Run on board
    ```
    python3 ORB.py baseline.bit
    ```
    replace the `baseline.bit` with your own bitstream. You should see something like:
    ```
    *** Program FPGA with baseline.bit ***
    *** Program FPGA done ***
    input shape: 480 640
    resized shape: 480 640
    *** Run Single test ***
    FAST threshold: 60
    Keypoints in img1: 443
    Keypoints in img2: 556
    *** Match and draw keypoints ***
    *** Run Multiple test ***
    FAST threshold: 40
    Average latency: 137.73664236 ms
    ```
    The output image (`matches.png`) is the feature matching result of two images, useit to check the quality of your output.

        <img src ="board/reference.png" width="100%"/>
    </p>

## Requirements
1. Make sure your design can be **successfully** run on the board.
1. You can make **any changes** on the baseline to **minimize** the latency.
	
	> Hint: You can use all the APIs in the Vitis Vision Library
1. You should write a report which may includes
    * Result screenshots in each step
    * The optimization strategies
    * The perfromance and resource utilization
    * Any problems you encountered
    * Any interesting ideas

## Grading
The final score is composed by three parts:
* **Base (60%):** Successfully run on the board with a latency **at least 50 ms**. 
* **Ranking:** This score is determined by your ranking position of the latency.
    * **30%:** Rank 1 to 10
    * **20%:** Rank 11 to 20
    * **10%:** Rank 21 to 30
    * **5% :** Rank 31 and below
* **Report (10%):** Report writing

## Submission: Deadline on 2026-1-11 23:59
You should submit:
* The source code and instructions on how to run it.
* Bitstream, HWH, and the host code (python script or executable files).
* Report in **PDF** format.

Please compress all the files in **ZIP** format.

## Overdue Policy
* Submit on time, get all scores.
* Submit within 24 hours of the deadline, get half of the score.
* Submit more than 24 hours after the deadline, get 0 score.
